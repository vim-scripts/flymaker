GNU Flymake allows Emacs users to perform compilation, static analysis, and
other tools in the background as they develop.  Upon each save, a
background process is kicked off to perform the checking.  If errors are
identified, the lines containing the error are highlighted and a tooltip
provides the error message.  This is very well-suited to feature development
where the developer spends a lot of time in a single buffer.

I can see the value in this fast-paced workflow but I don't use Emacs.
There have been a few attempts to bring this functionality to Vim but each
of them seem to have their limitations.  This plugin attempts to overcome
them.
